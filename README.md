# 🧠 Fact-Checking Q&A System using Completion Graphs and Mixture-of-Experts

![System Screenshot](https://github.com/tsd10/Fact-Checking-QnA-System---CG-and-MOEs/blob/main/System%20Working%20Screenshot.png)

This project presents a factual Q&A system built with **domain-specific expert LLMs**, a **question router**, and a **triple-based fact checker**. It is designed to answer natural language questions with high factual accuracy by leveraging a mixture-of-experts architecture and structured knowledge validation.

---

## 🔍 Idea Behind the Project

LLMs are powerful but prone to hallucination. To reduce factual errors and improve answer trustworthiness, we designed a **multi-stage architecture**:

1. **Domain Classification Router** (trained on Qwen2.5-7B):
   - Determines whether the input question belongs to `history`, `music`, or `politics`
2. **Expert Answering Module** (LoRA-finetuned Qwen2.5-3B models):
   - Answers questions using a domain-specific LLM
3. **Fact Verification Module** (Qwen2.5-3B classifier):
   - Validates factuality of the answer
4. **Triple Extraction + Matching**:
   - Extracts (head, relation, tail) triples from the answer and compares them to a known KG subset (Wikidata/CoDEx domain splits)

---

## 👤 My Contributions
This is a group project. My contributions: Implemented the triple extraction and matching module - extracting (head, relation, tail) triples from model outputs and comparing them against Wikidata and CoDEx domain KG subsets to evaluate factual grounding and identify hallucination failure modes.
